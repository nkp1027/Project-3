# Project-3
## Project Proposal
Our project goal is to create an online car rental business that offers a variety of vehicles that can be rented per hour at set prices of Ethereum. The majority of this will be created by a mix of Python and Streamlit while having connections to Ganache as well to show that the transactions are working. Ideally, a customer will visit the site, pick a car they would like to rent and select the number of hours they desire to rent it for. The price will automatically be calculated and displayed on the sidebar of the Streamlit app. Once this occurs, the customer can submit a transaction which will then prompt a confirmation and animation on the page.

Car Rental App
## Project Description
## Team Task Breakdown
All group members were responsible for individual research on new libraries that could be used for the app. It was a collaborative effort to build the app with the correct and precise coding required for it to function the way we intended it to. 
## Testing the App
In an effort to consolidate information and save time in teaching one to use this app successfully, we have uploaded a youtube video with step by step instructions. The link is provided below:
